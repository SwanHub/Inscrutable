# Plan:

## Create methods for each "move" a player or cpu can do...
## shift // jump // reverse // swap and their various forms... ()

## have the computer apply four of these moves to the ordered sequence in a
## randoml fashion.

## have the user choose one move at a time, while recording how many moves
## have been made.

## if the user gets the tiles all back in working order by move 4, then they win.
## if not, they can concede defeat and try again, concede defeat and quit,
## or concede defeat and continue until the game is over.

## I want to do some work with YIELD in this round. I also want to graduate
## from do...end and move into the more ubiquitous and professional realm of {}.
## I want this code to be written in 100 lines or less.
